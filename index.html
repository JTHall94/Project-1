      <p>Since moving to Lexington in 2014, I have come to love this city. It has everything you could ever want: farms, horses, churches, basketball, and even a Burlington Coat Factory. The people here are really nice actually, and not at all like what I always thought Kentucky would be like.</p>

      </p> There's lots to love about Lexington, but as I've gotten to know it over time, I've also realized that there is lots of CRIME. That's why I'm running for Constable, and why I need your vote. I, Michael Gary Scott, will bring justice to this beautiful city.</p>
    </div>
      <!-- This is a list for the issues that are most important to Michael -->
      <div class="container">
      <h3>The Issues</h3>

      <p>Below is a list of the four most important issues facing America, and by extension, Lexington. I promise to address these issues once I'm elected Constable:</p>

      <!--You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda. Global warming. Sex predators. Mercury poisoning. So do we just give up?-->
      <ul>
          <li>Global Warming</li>
          <li>Mercury Poisoning</li>
          <li>Crime</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <!-- This is to remind the user to go out and vote (for Michael) on Nov. 6th -->
      <div class="container">
      <h3>Get out and vote on November 6th!!</h3>

      <!--Says something inspiring/ridiculous.. maybe reuse a quote from the show -->
      <p>And don't forget to attend Michael Scott's First Annual Michael Scott for Constable Meredith Palmer Memorial Celebrity Campgain Fundraiser Halloween Fun Run Race For Justice, on October 27th!</p>
